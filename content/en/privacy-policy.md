We'll hold onto and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (like if we need to keep your data to obey applicable laws), hash out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. We're sticklers for the rules! ⚖️

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or if we're legally obligated to hold onto this data for longer. Better safe than sorry!

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your information (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get transferred to — and kept on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws might be different from yours. Wild, right? 🌍

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information means you're cool with that transfer. You're the boss! 😎

The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information. Pinky promise! 🔒

Our Service might let you zap certain info about you from right within the Service. Pretty handy! 👍

You can also get in touch with us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information you've given to us. We're here to help! 🙋‍♀️

But hey, just a heads-up, we might need to keep certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so. Some things gotta stay! 📜

### Disclosing Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. Stay in the loop! 🔔

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency). We gotta play by the rules! 🚔

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company may disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe such action is necessary to:

-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public
-   Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us! But hey, remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we totally try to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. We're doing our best, though! 🙏

## Kids' Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has handed over Personal Data to us, please get in touch. If we figure out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that information from our servers. Kids, talk to your parents! 👶👧

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires consent from a parent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info. Just making sure everyone's on board! ✅

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Stay safe out there! 🔗

We have absolutely no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just keeping it real! 🙅‍♀️
