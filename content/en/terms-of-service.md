# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

**ai.hubtoday** (hereinafter "the Site" or "we") welcomes you! 👋 Before you dive into our services, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By using or even just peeking at the Site, you're saying 'yep!' to these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
**Our services** at the Site offer users paid subscription content and member benefits. These include, but aren't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction. Remember, some content is just for our subscribed users! 💡

## 2. User Registration and Accounts
- **Users** must provide a valid email address and create a password to register for an account.
- **Your account's** security and all its activities are your responsibility, users. **Don't** transfer or share your account, seriously! 🙅‍♀️
- **The Site** has the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they break these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, with all fees clearly laid out on the checkout page. 💸
- **All payments** go through third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). The Site itself **won't** ever store your payment info, just so you know! 😉
- **Subscriptions** will **auto-renew**, so keep that in mind! Make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends if you don't want to continue.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** offers a full refund to first-time subscribers who aren't happy with the service within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're requesting it. Keep in mind, each user gets only one shot at a refund. For anything beyond 14 days or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** after payment, unless the law specifically says otherwise. Sorry! 🙏

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property
- **All original content** on this Site is **copyrighted by hubtoday**. You **cannot** copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission. 🚫
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content for personal learning and reading. That's it!
- **Commercial use** or extensive quoting? You'll need to reach out to the Site for authorization first!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Don't** upload, post, or spread any illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or rights-infringing content. Seriously, it's **forbidden**! 🛑
- **Don't** even think about using tech tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member content. That's a big no-no, **forbidden**! 🕵️‍♀️
- **The Site** can remove any inappropriate content and will **ban users** who break these rules. You've been warned! 🔨

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any or all services at any time, without giving you a heads-up beforehand. Just so you know!
- **The Site** **won't be responsible for compensation** if our content becomes temporarily unavailable due to things like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service interruptions. Tough luck, but that's how it goes sometimes! 🤷‍♂️

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided by the Site** is just for reference, folks. It **doesn't count** as professional advice – think financial, legal, medical, etc. – so don't treat it as such! ⚠️
- **The Site** **isn't responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services. Just a heads-up!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are all about the laws of California, USA 🇺🇸, and we'll interpret them that way, ignoring any conflict of law stuff. Got a beef related to these terms? Let's try to chat it out first, amicably, shall we? If that doesn't work, you agree that courts in Santa Clara County, California, will be the place to sort it out.
